Notes

-   [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi/issues/4202](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt.fyi/issues/4202)
    -   James G: Suspect that there's a hardcoded year somewhere. I am aware and will get to it.
-   [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/49752](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/49752)
    -   [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/218](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/218)
    -   Panos: This is blocking another [PR](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/49598).
    -   gsnedders: Waiting on the [RFC](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/218) to be approved. I did push something to the trigger branches. But I am trying to recall what happened.
    -   James S.: LGTM from the Google side.
    -   James G: If you can show that there are no unexplained regressions, I am fine with this. It would be great to have that evidence before moving forward with the RFC.
    -   Panos: Do we need to hold the RFC before the implementation?
    -   James G: There might be a nontrivial problem
    -   Panos: Seems like a very easy thing to do
    -   gsnedders: From memory, FF nightly, the things that failed also failed elsewhere. Chrome had a similar problem with TaskCluster
-   Safari stable aligned runs
    -   James G: [https://wpt.fyi/runs?label=master&label=stable&from=2025-01-28T00%3A00](https://wpt.fyi/runs?label=master&label=stable&from=2025-01-28T00%3A00) Sometimes Safari is not picking the same commit as other browsers. There might be a bug somewhere.
    -   gsnedders: [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/48659](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/48659)
    -   James G: Seems like we need to invert the logic. Are you expecting to look into this soon?
    -   gsnedders: Probably. But we don't have Github action jobs which have the different events
-   [RFC](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/208) 208
    -   gsnedders: The other library has a C implementation which means we can't vendor it in the first place. We don't actually have a problem with the cc01 license at that point.
    -   Panos: Where is that C implementation mentioned?
    -   gsnedders: [https://pypi.org/project/ed25519/](https://pypi.org/project/ed25519/)
    -   Panos: The RFC references [https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519](https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519). We don't want them to go back to the cc0 path?
    -   gsnedders: I will leave a comment. Happy to move forward with either option
    -   James G: No concerns here either
-   [RFC](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/215) 215
    -   gsnedders: Let's revisit this next month. Interested in any comments from James G. Also, what should be landed as tentative tests. Currently, you can land anything as a tentative test, which is not a good option
    -   James G: For tentative tests: In the case where something is not standardized at all, I don't really care how it is marked. The more interesting case is when that one test is in a directory full of standardized things. In theory, if we wanted to, we could link to an issue somewhere. Where parts of the specification have certain clauses. Not a big believer of having people add metadata to tests but in this case, I like that idea.
    -   gsnedders: Not the discussion of whether we should require metadata.
    -   James G: Long term, we can solve the issue with why a test is tentative with metadata
    -   gsnedders: Often tentative tests pass for only one vendor because they wrote the tests
    -   James G: Agree in theory because they don't get consensus. Back to the RFC: That list in the RFC should be fixed.
    -   Panos: An example might be Shadow Realms
    -   James G: Agreed that there may be tests where browser vendors are not the main drivers.
    -   gsnedders: There have been examples in CSS.
    -   James G: Also turn this to the core team as well.
    -   gsnedders: Process wise: Changes to RFCs gets a little confusing and makes the RFC repo not the best place for these types of changes
-   [RFC](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/216) 216
    -   James G: There is now an implementation [PR](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/50263). Thought people were in favor of not holding it up.
    -   James S: In favor of approving the RFC PR. I have not reviewed the implementation PR.
    -   gsnedders: I have more comments on the implementation, not the RFC. Do we want to create a certificate every time we start the server?
    -   James G: If performance becomes a concern we can always revisit and optimize
-   Mobile Investigation Meeting
    -   James G: Yeah. Do the same as last time?
    -   gsnedders: 2nd and 4th week of the month
    -   James G: Would require Sam to schedule that because Google Calendar does not allow that.
