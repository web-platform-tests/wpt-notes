## Agenda Items for Aug 6, 2024
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/44352


### Follow up on Accessibility API Mapping tests

Recap:
- [x] Alice: Create a RFC. Will include diagrams in an images directory

RFC: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/204

Notes:
- 

Action items:
- @all - review the RFC

### Porffor & .any.js tests
Recap: @ms2ger - There's a weird setup to accomplish this. Hoping there's a better way. Defer to August meeting.
Notes:
- @jgraham - Defer until next meeting

### (Blitz & testing without javascript - invite nico burns)
Recap: Defer to August meeting.
RFC: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/205
Notes:
- @nicoburns: Work on Taffy. Would be useful to run WPT suite against our library. Currently, we have tests that take HTML snippets with inline styles and runs those with test generation script with any browser. Generates Rust code. Would like to generate a unit test that runs from WPT suite.
- @jgraham: Need to talk to Gecko layout engineers about this. Because if it becomes a way to generate tests that aren't useful for browsers, then it would be helpful. But if it is, it could be easy to justify.
- @nicoburns: A smaller change: Some of the tests (order of 10s), depend on behavior of offset top and offset left of the layout. In some tests, the offset parent ends up being the root of the window. There's a difference in spec and implementation. Found this out in Servo. Would it be easier to just catch this case instead? [Issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10549)
- @jgraham: Are all these tests written by the same person?
- @nicoburns: Don't think so. If you're a mainstream browser, you are probably not running into this issue.

Action items:
- @nicoburns: Need to talk with the CSS working group. They should decide if the test needs to change

### Safari Runs Missing

Recap:
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/46899
- @gsnedders: This became worst after we migrated to MacOS Sonoma. But we are not running on Azure Pipelines for much longer. Have not taken a look at that

Notes:
- @gsnedders PR almost finished. Seems to be flaky but working on it.

### RFC [169](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/169)

Recap: @gsnedders - will chase this internally

Notes:
- @gsnedders: Provisional no. Anticipated this.


Action items
- @gsnedders: To comment on the RFC

### RFC Process Review

Recap
- [ ] Create a list of questions for a GitHub issue template
- [x] @past - create RFC to clarify details around review approvals before merging
  - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/199
- [ ] @all - Review RFC 199

Notes:
- @jgraham: Some part of is unclear. Will add a comment/question

Action items:
- @jgraham: to comment


### Taskcluster worker migration

Recap:
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/46967
- @jgraham: They are migrating the worker configuration. It breaks the Android testing. This is more of a FYI. Currently using docker worker, they want to move to generic worker.

Notes:
- @jgraham: Chrome was crashing on startup. Not sure if they have a deadline for this work

### Test suite quality review

RFC: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/206

Notes:
- @jgraham: Want to be clear about the issue that this is intended to solve. webstatus.dev is not really the scope for the project

Action item:
- @jcscottiii: Add more details around the problem we are trying to solve in WPT itself.

### Issue review: Simple test with require-trusted-types-for 'script'; CSP throws

Issue: Simple test with require-trusted-types-for 'script'; CSP throws
- Link: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/44352

Notes:
- Will ask if it needs to be closed

### LLM generated test policy

Issue: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/issues/202

Notes: 
- @jgraham: Is there a policy around using LLMs to generate tests. I know some organizations have policies on this. It would be helpful to people if there was an explicit policy. I think it should not impact reviews. If we say it is okay, would it be a problem to anyone's vendored repository? I suspect this may be already happening.
- @nicoburns: I know Servo recently adopted a policy for no LLM code. But don't think WPT would be impacted. Maybe we should have people disclaim they are using these tools.
- @gsnedders: WebKit has no overall policy about code from LLMs. Probably can't stop people from doing this.
- @weizhongx: Need to check for chromium but for Google we disallow it. Will check.

Action items:
- @weizhongx: To check the policy
