## Agenda Items for April 9, 2024

### GitHub Actions Migration

Will discuss next meeting with more people.

### RFC 185: Add WebDriver BiDi support to testdriver.js

Please review https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/185 and we could discuss it.

- jgraham: Left feedback. Will continue discussion on the PR.

### RFC 169

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/169

- jgraham: Apple would have more concerns more than any one else. Especially around codex licenses. Will wait for Sam to comment.

### RFC 190

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/190

- jgraham: Question for mathiasbynens is how they are using these metrics. For example: would they be upset if Gecko adds a bunch of subtests to existing tests that will cause Chrome to fail its metrics? Maybe we should drill down in the RFC the use cases. Maybe better query syntax will help?

Action item:
- [ ] @jgraham: Will comment on the RFC.

### Pywebsocket

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/45346
