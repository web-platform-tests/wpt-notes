### Edge runs broken

https://dev.azure.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/_build/results?buildId=104063&view=logs&jobId=2b376673-b6b7-55d3-67e2-e8305abf5c1e&j=2b376673-b6b7-55d3-67e2-e8305abf5c1e&t=74a04147-a139-56ed-eca1-af09b5915baa


Follow up on last meeting's action items:
- jgraham: Investigate the failure in more detail. Consider reverting (only if necessary)
- Add infrastructure job for Windows

- jgraham: Turned out to be fix a long time ago but no one did a release. 
- sam: There are runs now
- jcscottiii: Should we punt on the Windows infra jobs?
- jgraham: Yeah, It's not urgent

### Chrome stable results missing - [Link](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/41221)

- jcscottiii: During the stable runs, wpt cannot find the matching ChromeDriver for Chrome 115. So instead, it downloads the latest ChromeDriver which is for Chrome 116. Adoption of Chrome For Testing should fix this. On our [backlog](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/40119) to complete this quarter. In the meantime, might have to pin it, then revert it after the Chrome 116 [Release](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule) on Aug 15

- sam: Do we know what why it is not pulling the right version?
- jcscottiii: Not sure. Will need to look into it.

Action items:
- jcscottiii: To do more research on what is causing the right ChromeDriver to not be retrieved.

### [RFC 157](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/157) - Add feature meta tag to web-platform-tests meta data

Recap: Added note to RFC about to revert and who will be doing initial contributions

- Discussion regarding alternatives in comment

- jgraham: This is sort of like a spec link and sort of like a label. I think one or the other would be better. Prefer that we add to the META.yml instead of the in-test changes. But then, if we don't put it in the test and the test changes, things can become stale. A bigger TPAC discussion would be consolidating all the metadata into the tree. It would be nice to have a PR bot or check that requires extra review if changing metadata. Should not block this RFC. 
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt-metadata/pull/1420
- jgraham: Preferred option is have the metadata in separate files in either WPT or wpt-metadata and have some process that does the generation. Rather instead of the adding on the existing manifest generation

Action items:
- Refine RFC to use a separate file and manifest generation process

### [WPT Issue 40952](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/40952) - Can not run base test alone when a test file has variants

Follow up on last meeting:
- weizhong: Add changes on top of jgraham's changes
    - subsuite support: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/39711 
    - checking mozlog: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/41183
    - subsuite name in log: change ready in chromium: https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4731872
- weizhong: add a RFC for option 1.
    - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/158
    - https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/41047

- weizhong: The RFC and and PR are ready. Made changes on top of James G's changes. And the tests are passing. 
- jgraham: Has not reviewed the patch yet (waiting on the RFC). But the RFC is good.
- sam: what needs to be changed?
- jgraham: need to vendor in mozlog.
