Notes

-  RFC [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/219](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/219) 
    -  Kiara: So we can test web extensions API. Something we discussed at TPAC. Aiming for something in a cross platform way. There have been discussions on how to load the extensions. Looking for suggestions for the best approach.
    -  Alex: Left some comments on the PR. Implements both specifications. Should only do one. How do we handle BiDi and Classic. Created a PR. There will be changes to the specification and want to be able to handle those.
    -  James G: RFC seems fine. Added comments. It really is a wrapper around an existing test type. I would like to see more about the actual protocol it is implementing. Not sure I understand the discussion between BiDi and Classic. Gecko currently implements this in BiDi and marionette which is like Classic. API seems semantically identical. Preference would be to put it in the test driver namespace. 
    -  Alex: Not if it falls in the BiDi namespace. The issue is that we have put things into the BiDi namespace but it would be weird to have some things there and some things not there.
    -  James G: Responding to that.I think it is fine not to put it in the BiDi namespace. We should check if there's a common feature set between the two. And then it doesn't matter.
    -  Panos: This is something that is temporary correct? Just want to clarify that
    -  David: Yes. Safari considers this temporary
    -  Kiara: Based on the BiDi spec. What's the best route forward? Seems like we would still use testdriver to make these calls. Correct?
    -  James G: I agree. These are all implementation details that should be opaque to the end user. They should not care what the backend is. There is some leakage for the Chrome implementation. Say in RFC that it can be implemented in the BiDi specification or classic specification then everyone should be happy. Any concerns?
    -  Alex: Sounds fine. Our RFC says you can add one endpoint under the namespace and another not under the namespace. If we don't want to expose anything to end user, keep classic as implementation detail.
    -  James G: I suspect that Gecko will implement the classic endpoint (if not already implemented). Not strange that some vendors are implementing Classic and others are using BiDi. The main thing is to avoid conflict. But in the future, we can revisit if needed.
    -  Alex: Sam raised the question if it should be a wrapper or not. But we need to consider how to make it work with the BiDI feature flag.
    -  James G: Good point. Extension.js can opt in to BiDi. any.js would be harder and needs more thought.
    -  Tomislav: Couldn't that signal be in the wrapper. Can we do it just from the template itself?
    -  Alex: I have an alternative implementation. window.js tests could also have the flavor it requires. 
        -  [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/51090/files#diff-62b87ca926b8bc96565f205ca91dca50084cb041aaba7cf990fe0625c2eb9556](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/51090/files#diff-62b87ca926b8bc96565f205ca91dca50084cb041aaba7cf990fe0625c2eb9556) 

    -  Oliver: one of the things, well, the thing we're discussing, if I understand correctly is whether or not we use extension.js or window.js, One of the things we discussed wanting to do longer term in the future is having like special meta tags where we can say, like, rather than providing an extension please.
    -  Tomislav: If there are no strong preferences, I would vote for the proposal as written currently.
    -  James G: In favor of all the things we have discussed. 
    -  Next steps:
        -  James G: I would like to see the PR correspond with the RFC. Adding a new wrapper type instead of a new test type.
        -  Alex: Decide which is best for you from the extensions perspective.

-  [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/50649](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/50649)
    -  Panos: Philip's PR to Ubuntu 24.04. GitHub is having brownouts. This is a reminder just in case.
    -  James G: I will look into this.
    -  Ms2ger: Not sure if CI is sufficient. But I don't think there's an issue.
    -  Panos: This is for the Safari runs?
    -  James G: This is the epoch runs. I think we should just approve it. If it breaks anything, we will need to fix it anyway.

-  RFC [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/218](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/218)
    -  Panos: I think Sam wanted James G to do the review as discussed last time.
    -  James G: Will take a look

-  RFC [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/208](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/208)
    -  Panos: We should revisit our process. The process as written says we should delay by one meeting.
    -  James G: I don't think there were any objections anymore. So yes we could follow that. I'm neutral. Neutral = implicit support
    -  Panos: I will ping Sam and wait a few days

-  Safari stable aligned runs update
    -  Defer until next meeting

-  RFC [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/215](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/215)
    -  Defer until next meeting

-  RFC [https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/216](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/216)
    -  James G: Looks like we can merge this?
    -  James S: Agreed

-  FYI: James G: Merged the Python 3.13 support. So if people see breakage, it could be that.
