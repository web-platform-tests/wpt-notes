## Agenda Items for Sept 5, 2023

Attendees: @jgraham, @past, @jcscottiii, @WeizhongX, @gsnedders 


### DockerHub billing issues

Background: Received a notice that billing failed for the webplatformtests Docker organization. Turns out the OSS sponsorship ran out. Kyle Ju re-applied but waiting to hear back from Docker

Discussion:
- Is it time to move off of DockerHub for image registry?

- jgraham: Only reason we are still on DockerHub is just no one has put in the effort. But moving to use GitHub Registry should be easy. Only blocker is just someone having time to complete.
- jcscottiii: Does there need to be a RFC
- jgraham: Probably should.
- panos: Is there any change in the local setup?
- jgraham: no
- panos: @jgraham, I think you looked into it in a previous meeting
- jgraham: Looked into the docs.
- jgraham: We should definitely do this work but let's wait until we hear back from Docker.

Next steps:
- [ ] unassigned: Someone complete a RFC
- [ ] Next meeting, report on DockerHub decision.


### REGRESSION(#35973): test types no longer run in deterministic order ([Issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/41476))

Discussion:
- Reverting should not impact the performance enchancement. So we should for now.
- sam: Agree, that order shouldn't matter but there's evidence that we should keep it ordered for now.

Next steps:

- [ ] @WeizhongX - revert the change to add the ordered iterator back



### WPT: Allow window.onload to contain multiple test()s ([Issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/38806))

Background: Previously did not merge because James S. wanted a green build (FF stability [checks](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/runs/14949853035) were failing at the time). But the results did come in fine. Rebased and re-running the tests now.

Discussion: Given the steps performed in this [comment](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/38806#issuecomment-1625407955), as long as we get results again, can James S. force merge?

Next steps:
- [ ] jcscottiii - Use the diff view in wpt.fyi.  Notes from @jgraham: Look at the diffs. Reftests could be flakiness. Check if the diffs come from stable tests or not. If there's one change in every browser, that suggests the change has affected the test. If it only has affected one browser, could be flakiness.

### Add async condition support to step_wait_func ([Issue](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/34289))

Discussion: [Comment](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/34289#issuecomment-1695927090)

Next steps:
- [ ] panos - Will rebase with a newer base

### RFC #163: Add web_feature metadata file to web-platform-tests ([RFC](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/163))

Discussion:

Next steps:
- [ ] jgraham - To take a look at the RFC

sam: https://www.w3.org/events/meetings/c56c32f9-0543-4224-b3d1-edd1dec2d3aa/
jgraham: No, we should put one together. Possibly mobile and dockerhub. Let's discuss this on the matrix channel.
