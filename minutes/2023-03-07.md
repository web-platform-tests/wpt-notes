## Agenda Items for March 7, 2023

### Python 3.7
jgraham: FYI: Previously Gecko had python 3.6. There is patch to upgrade 3.7 twice. Hopefully, within the next week, Gecko will no longer be the constraint on this upgrade. Maybe it is a good time to revisit how we vendor dependencies.

jcscott: Maybe we don't need it for it the version bump
sam: That is why we have the RFCs. For version bumps in the past.

Next steps:
- jgraham: will make a RFC for bumping the version

### Revisit [RFC 75](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/75) - async_promise_test

Recap: Last [meeting](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt-notes/blob/master/minutes/2023-02-07.md), we discussed that we should revisit this again. If not merged by next meeting, will merge. jgraham to review in between.

Next steps:
- Merged

### Revisit [RFC 110](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/110) - support virtual test suites in wptrunner

Recap: Last [meeting](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt-notes/blob/master/minutes/2023-02-07.md#revisit-rfc-110-httpsgithubcomweb-platform-testsrfcspull110---support-virtual-test-suites-in-wptrunner)

jgraham: Spent some time looking at the code on how to integrate in a first class way. Make it a pure configuration thing. Call it "subsuite". Can pass in keyword args /preferences for defining the features of a sub-suite. As of today, this seems to work. Example: running with private browsing on and private browsing off.

weizhong: How long for the patch?

jgraham: has been working on it. Next few days so you can at least try it out / see if it makes sense.

Next steps:
- jgraham: Will put together a patch for everyone to try out. weizhong to review it.

### [RFC 133](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/133) Add support for window-module as JavaScript global
Current status: Has 2 approvals

Discussion: Any objections before merging?

Merged

### [RFC 128](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/128) Consume User Activation
Current status: Waiting on the HTML [PR](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8609) to land before the RFC lands

Question: Anyone have contacts on the HTML repo to get that PR merged?

sam: how to deal with the circular dependency?

Next steps:
- Marcos needs to land this or write tests. Nothing for us to do on our side.

### [RFC 121](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/121) Add testdriver.js support for Custom Handlers registration
Current status: The HTML spec [PR](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/8267) was merged. There is also a [WPT PR](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/35792).

Discussion: Can we go ahead and merge the RFC? Or do we need to wait for the WPT PR?

Next steps:
- We can merge it and leave a comment saying it is not needed in the future.

### Discuss [WPT PR 38806](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/38806)
Current status: This PR changes the behavior for "late tests". Previously, the "late tests" were ignored. This change makes them included.

Discussion: Let's discuss if this PR requires a RFC. [Starting comment](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/38806#pullrequestreview-1328576790)

jgraham: Changing the behavior of testharness is sketchy. In general, we should have a RFC when changing the behavior of th tests. Had a conversation where CODEOWNERS are required to review

sam & jgraham: We should have a RFC

Next steps:
- jcscott - Do full runs
- jcscott - Make a RFC

### https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/117

Next steps:
- jcscott - ping philip

### https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/91
