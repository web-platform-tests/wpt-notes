## Agenda Items for July 2, 2024

### [Accessibility API Mapping tests](https://github.com/Igalia/wpt/blob/explainer/docs/wpt-for-aams.md#open-questions)
Background: invite alice boxhall/valerie young

Notes:
- @alice: Presenting diagram that shows a proposal to add Platform A11y APIs. Browser exposes information to assistive technologies. Those are OS specific. Within the browser, we have a computed accessibility tree and maps that onto the platform. This is largely untested. And becoming a bigger problem. What we have: The computed role and computed label in webdriver. WPT via HTTP -> Web Driver via [computedrole](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#get-computed-role)/[computedlabel](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver2/#get-computed-role) -> Computed A11y tree. Have a proof of concept [patch](https://github.com/Igalia/wpt/pull/2/files). [Details](https://github.com/Igalia/wpt/blob/explainer/docs/wpt-for-aams.md#proof-of-concept-patch)
  - Adds plaform specific ExecutorImpl classes
  - Add PlaformAccessibilityProtocolPart class in a new file, extending ProtocolPart (platform specific) - It's interesting that it is both the interface and the implementation
- @alice: Want to draw attention to the open [questions](https://github.com/Igalia/wpt/blob/explainer/docs/wpt-for-aams.md#open-questions)
- @jgraham: This is very interesting. Process wise we need a RFC to get explicit buy-in. We do not need to go through all the implementation but it seems reasonable.
- @past: Does this gets us on-par with the existing webdriver?
- @alice: The existing methods will be speaking to the computed generic a11y tree. This is more of a yes and _ solution. There is a proposal by James Craig to expose more a11y info via webdriver, but that doesn't actually test that the tree is correctly exposed to each specific platform API. Having the ability to test the computed tree provides a way to isolate where the issue is - the tree needs to be correct in order for the mapping to expose the right thing, but there may be a bug in the mapping, and if the right information isn't exposed to the APIs themselves then it won't work for users.
- @past: So the idea is have a more accurate conformance test suite?
- @alice: Correct

- @gsnedders: Would prefer different expectations
- @alice: Currently (in the POC) doing the same things as getcomputedrole and getcomputedname. What we really want to do: Get more granular information. (Look at AAM specs). For somethings, there are different number of properties. There could be different tests depending on the platform. Right now, we have [if-else depending on the API](https://github.com/Igalia/wpt/pull/2/files#diff-4c6cae4648eadb186a175370e04a9e9581664a469c60fdb72d0d20600b28adeb) (e.g. atspi, axapi). We probably want to be able to call for more information depending on the API. Which may mean different tests.
- @jgraham: Not quite standardized. No existing precedent for platform-specific testing

- @alice: Regarding RFCs: Tried explaining things without diagrams. But the diagrams are necessary. Can I add diagrams?
- @jgraham: Yes

Action items:
- [ ] Alice: Create a RFC. Will include diagrams in an images directory

### Porffor & .any.js tests
Background: There's a weird setup to accomplish this. Hoping there's a better way.

Notes:
- @ms2ger: Defer to next meeting

### (Blitz & testing without javascript - invite nico burns)
Background:
Notes:
- @ms2ger: Defer to next meeting

### Safari Runs Missing

Background: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/46899

Notes:
- @gsnedders: This became worst after we migrated to MacOS Sonoma. But we are not running on Azure Pipelines for much longer. Have not taken a look at that

### WPT [PR](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/45823) - Add testdriver support for WebDriver BiDi

Notes:
- @jgraham: Will take a look at this


### RFC [169](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/169)

Action items from last meeting:

- [ ] @gsnedders - will chase this internally


### GitHub Actions Migration

Action items from last meeting:
- [x] @past - Bring this up to the Microsoft team in the Interop meeting
  - [x] Sent an email out

Notes:
- @past: Microsoft will do the migration from Azure Pipeline to GitHub Action. Targeted for August.
- @gsnedders: They think the Azure Pipelines will have enough capacity for the Windows jobs alone. So are they moving to GH actions?
- @past: They are doing both. Migrate some actions.
- @jgraham: Sounds like they are looking into it. But cannot find if it was discussed during the Interop meeting.
- @past: Should check back in a month?
- @gsnedders: The plan is have a bunch of self hosted GitHub action machines for the CI. The main thing is moving everything over to GitHub Actions. Coming in a few weeks.
- @past: Revisit next meeting then

### RFC Process Review

Action items from last meeting
- [ ] Create a list of questions for a GitHub issue template
- [x] @past - create RFC to clarify details around review approvals before merging

Background:
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/199

Notes:
- @past: Only suggestions with consensus were captured.

Action items:
- [ ] @all - Review RFC 199

### Taskcluster worker migration

Background:
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/46967

Notes:
- @jgraham: They are migrating the worker configuration. It breaks the Android testing. This is more of a FYI. Currently using docker worker, they want to move to generic worker.


### Dockerhub migration

Background:
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/46279

Notes:
- @jgraham: Pretty happy with this being merged. No objections.
