## Agenda Items for Feb 6, 2024

### Firefox tests

https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/44366

- @jgraham - There's a crash in websockets. Failing to recover. There's a bugzilla bug. Someone is working on it. Assuming it lands, will ask to uplift it.

Action item
- [ ] File a bug to investigate why we are unable recover from this

### Parallel tests using shared resources (clipboard)

[Issue] https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1866605

Discussion: Revisit RFC action item

- jgraham - It is causing intermittent errors for us as well. I know Jbedard was saying they were experiencing this too
- sam: Two sides. 1) Figuring out which tests to run serially. 2) Implementing that in wptrunner.
- jgraham - In the clipboard is pretty straight forward. Could have a meta that give a resource name that will do either clever scheduling or some lock
- sam: How we want to put the metadata for things to run serially.
- jgraham: RFC should be for wptrunner. How to add additional overrides and suggest an implementation strategy. In my first instance, I would suggest a lock. But if people are keen on the fancy scheduling, then we can discuss that on the RFC.
- sam: at least file an issue in the RFC repo.

Action item:
- [ ] File an issue - @jgraham
- [ ] Draft a RFC - unassigned


### Keep test metadata in sync with test when subtests are deleted or renamed.

[Issue] https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/issues/43499

Updates from weizhong

- weizhong: Found solution from outside. Mark the tests as failed. Issue is closed.
- sam: That is a change in semantics. Instead of looking a simple pass and fail, looking at metadata. May not be bad. We are considering tests that disappear as failures.
- weizhong: not a change in wptrunner. Have another tool (called baseline tool). If a test fails, that tool will find a new baseline for the tests. Not sure if there's interest to fix upstream. If not, we will keep it on our side.
- jgraham: if you have a test that intermittently does not run the sub test, could have a scenario where the baseline tool may re-adjust incorrectly. But maybe the baseline tool accounts for that.
- weizhong: the issue shouldn't be a problem
- sam: James is talking about flaky tests
- jgraham: If you have three synchronous tests and an exception is raised and the last one doesn't run.
- weizhong: for intermittent tests, we have another tool that would mark the whole test as fail.
- sam: is there a way to mark a sub-test as intermittent?
- weizhong: for now, no.

Action item:
- [ ] weizhong will follow up on the intermittent issue.



### wpt.live long term

jcscottiii - to provide usage stats on wpt.live

- jgraham & sam: followed up internally and there's a strong sense it would be bad if it went away.
-

### RFC 173
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/173
- jgraham: Any objections given there's active support?
- sam: no
- jgraham: merged

### RFC 178
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/178
- sam: Tried something similar. But I think there was a problem on how to raise the PRECONDITION_FAILED back up. Doesn't mean we shouldn't do it. But there may be a lot of complexity
- jgraham: I agree. This will probably require implementation changes from all browsers before. So we need to make sure every one is bought in.
- sam: Would we want run something that returns precondition_failed instead of skip. Skipping does have the disadvantage of not knowing when to enable again though

Next steps:
- [ ] Sam & jbedard: read through the RFC and comment.


### RFC 168

- RFC: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/168

Notes from last meeting: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt-notes/blob/47c3ea1a941c0b0f78869ff2d00a2e2f93594636/minutes/2023-11-07.md?plain=1#L24

- Note added to the RFC PR


### RFC 169
- https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/169
- sam: Discussion on the number of dependencies it added. Especially `ffmpeg`.
- jgraham: There may be a way to avoid pulling in all the codecs. Not completely sure or not.

Action item:
- [ ] Add a comment to RFC with an update on opinions - sam

### RFC 180
- RFC: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/180

Action item:
- [ ] Wait for Philip to respond.
