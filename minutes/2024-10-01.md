## Agenda Items for Oct 1, 2024


## RFCs
 
### 207 https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/207


Action item:
- [ ] @jcscottiii: Will follow up with author

### 208 https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/208
 
RFC adding third party Ed25519, HPKE, and CBOR libs 

Recap: Please un-resolve any discussions that are still open.

Notes:
- @jgraham: Unresolving comments now. There's an undelying problem. Apple has a problem with licensing. Not sure how to resolve this if licensing is the issue. Or maybe make it optional.
- @past: Only one library had the issue, right?
- @jgraham: We need Apple to verify. Refer to https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/208#discussion_r1728091547
- @past: Nobody ships WPT in a product. Just sometimes run in their infra/ci
- @jgraham: Maybe revisit the option on how to optionally run it. Similar to how we did http3
- @past: Each vendor needs to talk to their respective legal organizations about licensing since we are not shipping WPT.
- @jgraham: Is the problem 1) vendoring or 2) we can't have any dependencies with conflicting licenses.

Action item:
- [ ] @gsnedders: Need to track down the newly unresolved comments with Apple legal.
 
### 199 https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/199
 
 - Panos: jgraham to update with his comments

Notes:
- @past: If I'm okay with the edits, I can merge?
- @jgraham: Yes

### 178 https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/178

Recap: Comments left.

Notes:
- wait for author to follow up

### 210 https://github.com/web-platform-tests/rfcs/pull/210

Notes:
- @past: The original issue in WPT had a mention for bazel overlay files. 
- @ms2ger: Still trying to understand the benefit of this.
- @past: Cloudflare uses bazel to build
- @jgraham: Confusing to have bazel in the tree. Might be better to go with the bazel overlay file instead of placing the files in tree. Then if more people want it, then we can revisit.
- @past: We try to take contribution when more than one vendor uses it since it is shared infra.

Action items:
- [ ] @jgraham: will write a comment
